# Shitty controls

This is just a repository for some control of hardware that are used on a bunch of different computers. It is no where near as good as:

 1. (salve)[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/slave/0.3.3]
 2. (pyvias)[https://pyvisa.readthedocs.io/en/stable/]
 3. (PyDAQmx)[https://pypi.python.org/pypi/PyDAQmx]


 or any of the other good controls.

Most of this is based on the simple (pyserial)[https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/pyserial.html]. 

 This has only been written if there has been an issue getting these others to work, and it was quicker to find scripts that other people have written online.
